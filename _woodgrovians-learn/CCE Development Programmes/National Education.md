# **National Education**

Through our National Education (NE) curriculum and programmes, , we seek  to equip our Woodgrovians  with the civic knowledge, understanding, skills, values, motivation and identity so that they will be able to play their roles well as concerned citizens and active contributors, and to co-construct the next chapter of Singapore.

NE is anchored on the following citizenship dispositions, which enable our  Woodgrovians to realise their part in the flourishing of the community and nation:

*   A sense of belonging: To develop a deeper understanding of who we are, and a shared understanding of the values that are important to us as a nation.
*   A sense of reality: To be aware of the contemporary realities – including Singapore’s constraints and vulnerabilities – which affect us as a nation amidst the backdrop of a less predictable world.
*   A sense of hope: Having confidence and optimism in Singapore’s future and the resilience to face the challenges ahead.

Through these citizenship dispositions, we hope to cultivate in our Woodgrovians the will to act as active citizens who have a collective resolve and a sense of shared mission towards building a Singapore for all.
