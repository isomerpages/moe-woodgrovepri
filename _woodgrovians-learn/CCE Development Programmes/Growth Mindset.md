# **Growth Mindset**

In line with our school’s philosophy ‘Every Child can Shine’, the school embarks on Growth Mindset curriculum that aims to develop our Woodgrovians to become confident persons, self-directed learners, active contributors and concerned citizens.

Since its inception in 2020, our Woodgrovians  have been taught   the Growth Mindset principles during their Assembly periods. They  engaged in  hands-on activities where they learnt strategies on effective learning, life-skills such as coping mechanisms and time-management, and competencies such as leveraging on one’s strengths and paying it forward, needed for them to maximise their individual and collective potential.
