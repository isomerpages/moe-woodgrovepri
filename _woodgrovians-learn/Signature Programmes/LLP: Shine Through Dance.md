Our Life-Long Learning Programme in Dance started in 2011. The programme exposes students (Primary 1-6) to the unique benefits of dance.  The 3E approach to Dance in Woodgrove – Expose, Experience, Express, allows our pupils to gain knowledge and appreciation of the many dance genres over the six years.

Values and character education also plays a crucial role in ensuring the success of the Dance programme. From learning  the varied dance skills to coordinating dance routines, students develop self confidence and mutual respect for one another as they strive towards a common goal at the end of each year’s programme – to showcase their dance routines to the entire level.

The finale of the programme is a colourful and upbeat dance musical put up by the primary six graduating classes where pupils take on a multitude of roles as assistant choreographers, coordinators, backstage managers, actors and dancers. The extravaganza has received highly positive feedback from teachers, parents and most importantly, our pupils! The learning experience and wonderful memories created through the Dance programme have certainly enhanced our pupils’ efforts to be Thinkers, Learners and Leaders with Character.
