# **Curriculum Innovation**

### MakerSpace

In our effort to develop innovative and creative thinking, Woodgrovians are given the opportunities to explore new areas, tinker with ideas and tools, solve real life problems, and create solutions through Makerspace programme. Makerspace hinges on STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts & Mathematics) activities that include coding, construction, and craft works to promote innovation and creativity. Soft skills such as collaboration, communication and interpersonal skills are also embedded within the Makerspace@WGPS Framework.
