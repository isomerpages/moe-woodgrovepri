### MakerSpace

In our effort to develop innovative and creative thinking, Woodgrovians are given the opportunities to explore new areas, tinker with ideas and tools, solve real life problems, and create solutions through Makerspace programme. Makerspace hinges on STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts & Mathematics) activities that include coding, construction, and craft works to promote innovation and creativity. Soft skills such as collaboration, communication and interpersonal skills are also embedded within the Makerspace@WGPS Framework.

### Real World Learning in Action

Through Real World Learning, P1 to P5 Woodgrovians are taken through task-based interdisciplinary project works (IPW) that allow them to synthesise knowledge from various areas of learning so that they can critically and creatively apply it to real-life situations. Harnessing the affordances of various ICT tools that complement IPW projects, Real World Learning engenders sharpening of new media literacies among our students. The outcomes from Real World learning will lead to Woodgrovians creating products as part of the school’s Values in Action (VIA) community outreach.

Below shows an overview of the span of Real World Learning projects across the levels.
