# **Green @WGPS**

 In line with the school mission of building character, nurturing hearts and enriching minds, environmental education is a cornerstone of schooling at WGPS. Green @ WGPS hopes to educate, inspire and empower every Woodgrovian to be an environmental steward through a school-wide and in-depth approach in environmental education which involves staff (teaching and non-teaching) and the student population in green efforts. 

### Woodgrovians Reduce, Reuse and Recycle!

#### Green Leadership

Green Leaders are trained by the Green Committee on the current issues so that they can be stewards who lead their peers in participating in the green movement. The role of Green Leaders is rotated annually so that more Woodgrovians can have the opportunity to develop their leadership skills in this area. Green leaders also participate in trainings by our partners so that they have greater awareness on current environmental issues. 

#### Woodgrovians Reduce, Reuse and Recycle!

Woodgrovians actively practice the 3Rs – Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. The Green Committee raises awareness on the amount of waste generated by Singapore such as through sharing on how Semakau may not be able to sustain unless we commit to the 3Rs.

Our recycling corners in the classroom encourages Woodgrovians to recycle daily. Woodgrovians also encourage their family members to recycle during our Festive Drives that take place before major festivals like Chinese New Year, Hari Raya and Deepavali. During these festive drives, we bring our recyclables to the blue bin in school or in our neighborhood.

#### Woodgrovians Unite in National Green Movements!

Woodgrovians share the spirit of National Green Movements like World Water Day, Earth Day and Biodiversity Week. Together with our partners such as like PUB, The Earth Society and NParks, we put in effort to raise awareness on environmental issues in Singapore. Green Leaders also co-organize exciting game booths and sharing sessions to spread the awareness amongst their peers during these occasions.
