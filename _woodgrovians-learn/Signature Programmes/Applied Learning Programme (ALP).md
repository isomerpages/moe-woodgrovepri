Applied Learning Programme (ALP) was implemented in Woodgrove Primary School in 2017 to enhance the development of literacy skills, foster a strong spoken culture and develop students’ talent in the spoken language. 

To develop the students’ imagination and creative powers as producers, performers and evaluators, the students will be involved in role play, improvisation, Readers' Theatre, script writing and play production. Through drama, language comes to life, and students will experience meaningful, fluent interaction in the English language; and assimilate a whole range of pronunciation, new vocabulary and structures.

Our aims in ALP are to:

1.  provide a structured developmental training for students in oral skills;  
    
2.  create opportunities for students to develop social and personal leadership through a learner-centric approach; and  
    
3.  develop students’ understanding of social issues as they learn how other  
    
4.  dramatists have communicated their understanding  
    

During ALP lessons, students are encouraged to be creative by experimenting with dialogue, space, and sound in drama lessons. Such activities help students gain confidence, and develop different means of expression. Students also learn skills of portraying a character through different techniques vocally and gain experience with how to critique practical work, and how to use feedback positively to improve the quality of their thinking.  Students showcase their talents during the English Language Fiesta (ELF).
