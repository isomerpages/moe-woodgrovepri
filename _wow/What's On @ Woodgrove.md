Through the camp, P5 students contributed through one way or another, forging team spirit and lead each other to success.</p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nTCRpMJ8xZk?si=A-Cna3HoKXFJc59N&amp;rel=0"></iframe></div><p></p><hr><h3><strong>Welcoming P1 to the Woodgrovian family!</strong></h3><p>"On 2 January, Tuesday we welcome our new P1 Woodgrovians!

The occasion was more special than usual as we also kickstarted our school’s 25th Anniversary Celebrations. Not only do we have a special rendition of the “Happy Birthday” song – with our staff playing the Kalimba (a thumb piano), it was also cakes galore for everyone. To top it off, every family also receives one of commemorative Woodgrovian bears – Sparkle and Shine! Watch the video and share our joy!</p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/okIOlc2Zk6k?si=uMjJd1QMEZ3BzmGZ&amp;rel=0"></iframe></div><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
