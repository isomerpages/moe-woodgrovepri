<p>Woodgrovians started the first day of term 2 in high spirits as our very
own mascots – Sparkle and Shine – welcomed them back to school early in
the morning! After a week of break, it was nice to see our Woodgrovians
walking into school with enthusiasm and smiles, all ready for a new term
of learning. We started the day in the hall with a resounding school cheer
to a great start, before heading back to class for lessons. Watch the video
to share our joy and excitement on the first day of school in term 2!</p>

<p>Our sporting Woodgrovians took part in the 2024 National Schools Games
(NSG) Opening ceremony @ OCBC Arena which was graced by Mr Chan Chun Sing,
Minister of Education. The ceremony emphasized the importance of values
and character that form the foundation of sporting excellence. Our Woodgrovians
cheered together with 30 other schools from all over Singapore in the NSG
Cheer with gusto and pride. They also experienced a unique opportunity
to view the Secondary school’s NSG competitions at the OCBC Arena. Watching
their senior counterparts definitely motivated our own sports teams to
strive even harder for the upcoming Primary Schools NSG.</p>
<p>Back in school, we prepared for our very own Woodgrove NSG Opening Ceremony
and what a proud moment it was for the representatives from Badminton,
Table Tennis, Football, Rope Skipping and Basketball! They stood proudly
on stage for the Athlete’s Oath as well as recited our own Woodgrovian
Pledge, reiterating character development through sporting excellence.</p>
<p>The ceremony marks our Woodgovian’s participation in the NSG and we wish
them all the best as they strive towards Sporting and Character Excellence.</p>

<h3><strong>P5 Camp ACE for Bolt the Cheetah!</strong></h3>
<p>The P5 started the year with an exciting outdoor adventure camp to strengthen
their resilience, build new bonds and deepen existing relationships. They
were given new experiences where they went beyond their comfort zone like
kayaking and caving, acquiring new skills and attitudes, exhibiting courage,
resilience and adaptability in overcoming challenges and obstacles. Through
this camp, P5 students were seen to live up to the school’s values and
motto! Check out the video below!</p>

<h3>Happy Birthday Woodgrove!.</h3>
<p>We had a blast during our first Monthly Birthday celebration on 3 Jan
2024. The occasion was more special than usual as we also kickstarted our
school’s 25th Anniversary Celebrations. Not only do we have a special rendition
of the “Happy Birthday” song – with our staff playing the Kalimba (a thumb
piano), it was also cakes galore for everyone. To top it off, every family
also receives one of commemorative Woodgrovian bears – Sparkle and Shine!
Watch the video and share our joy!</p>
