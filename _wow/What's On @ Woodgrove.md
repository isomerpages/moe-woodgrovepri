<h4>Woodgrovians Cheering to a Strong Start in 2024!</h4>
<p>On Tuesday, 23 January, our students started their day on a positive note
    with their level cheers. After close to a month of learning and growing
    together with their classmates and teachers, they were excited to showcase
    their level cheers and signature mascot moves that morning! Checkout the
    video below to see the enthusiastic actions and hear the resounding cheers
    from Woodgrovians as they began their day in high spirits to a strong start
    of the year!</p>

<h3><strong>P5 Camp ACE for Bolt the Cheetah!</strong></h3>
<p>The P5 started the year with an exciting outdoor adventure camp to strengthen
    their resilience, build new bonds and deepen existing relationships. They
    were given new experiences where they went beyond their comfort zone like
    kayaking and caving, acquiring new skills and attitudes, exhibiting courage,
    resilience and adaptability in overcoming challenges and obstacles. Through
    this camp, P5 students were seen to live up to the school’s values and
    motto! Check out the video below!</p>

    <h3>Happy Birthday Woodgrove!.</h3>
    <p>We had a blast during our first Monthly Birthday celebration on 3 Jan
        2024. The occasion was more special than usual as we also kickstarted our
        school’s 25th Anniversary Celebrations. Not only do we have a special rendition
        of the “Happy Birthday” song – with our staff playing the Kalimba (a thumb
        piano), it was also cakes galore for everyone. To top it off, every family
        also receives one of commemorative Woodgrovian bears – Sparkle and Shine!
        Watch the video and share our joy!</p>
