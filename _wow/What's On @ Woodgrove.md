<h3><strong>Woodgrove Symphonies @Woodlands Regional Library 2024</strong></h3>
<p></p><a class="isomer-image-wrapper" href="https://youtu.be/_BIaUzLK3ZI?si=gFG1NN0iKPAsZR1T"><img style="width: 70%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/270924.png"></a>
<p>Our inaugural Woodgrove Symphonies @ Woodlands Regional Library was a
HUGE success, with some offbeats, wrong moves, missing notes …BUT filled
with endless encouragements, awesome opportunities to build confidence,
nurture talents and passion. Not perfect but definitely excellent, such
imperfection makes excellence. We would like to thank all the parents who
have supported the performance and everyone who have enabled our Woodgrovians
to SOAR(Seizing, Opportunities, Aspiration, Realised) so that they can
shine even brighter. Even bringing the many CCA groups to watch in itself
is a great learning opportunity. An appreciative member of the public wrote
in to us to commend the performers for their effort in preparing for this
concert, showing great resilience despite minor hiccups and were fully
committed to completing their performances. She was full of praise for
our student ushers, though not the stars of the show, were warm and welcoming.
They had given her a wonderful first impression of the school.</p>
<p>The NLB Organising Team said that it was a good &amp; interactive performance.
Even the rain did not dampen our spirit!</p>
<p>Much thanks goes to the many who came by to join in the fun &amp; support
as well.</p>
<p>Our Woodgrovians have indeed ‘SOARed’ and will continue to ‘Shine’!</p>

<h3><strong>Teachers’ Day @ Woodgrove</strong></h3>
<p></p><a class="isomer-image-wrapper" href="https://youtu.be/j5_L7EX3dwk?si=2_hGRqK3LHgHyd4X"><img style="width: 70%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/221341q4.png"></a>
<p>Teachers' Day is a huge affair in Woodgrove not because it is a period
where we show appreciation to our committed teachers, but also because
it is such a wonderful platform to nurture Gratitude in our Woodgrovians.
Throughout Term 3, Woodgrovians participated in numerous activities beyond
the classroom during recess and even at home to creatively dedicate their
appreciation to their teachers. Through such an authentic application,
Woodgrovians experienced the value of gratefulness in action while creating
beautiful shared memories with their schoolmates and teachers. We are also
most grateful for the overwhelming support and appreciation efforts by
parents and our Parent Support Group. Thank you for galvanising us in our
mission to help everyone of our Woodgrovians shine!</p>

<p>On 8 August, our school was abuzz with excitement as we came together
to celebrate our nation's 59th birthday. The day was marked by a series
of engaging activities that highlighted our collective pride in our nation
and school spirit. Woodgrovians started their day in the hall by saying
their birthday wishes to Singapore accompanied by the Observance Ceremony
as a mark of respect to the country and a reminder of our shared identity
and values. Following the ceremony, our Woodgrovians participated in the
Recollections which brought about a deeper meaning and appreciation for
the opportunities they have today. One of the highlights of the day was
the singing of national day songs. The air was filled with joyous melodies
and the enthusiastic voices of the students who sang with a spirited gusto!
Here's wishing everyone, Happy National Day!</p>

<p>Our P5 Woodgrovians attended the National Education (NE) Show at the Padang
on 6 July, joining the celebrations for Singapore's 59th birthday. This
year’s theme, "Together, as One United People," encouraged all Singaporeans
to express their love for the nation, celebrate its progress, and show
care and concern for fellow citizens. Our Woodgrovians had the privilege
to witness a spectacular display of military defense, the Red Lions' parachute
team, and various performances that highlighted the vibrant spirit of National
Day. Happy Birthday, Singapore &amp; Majulah Singapore!</p>

<p>Our sporting Woodgrovians took part in the 2024 National Schools Games
(NSG) Opening ceremony @ OCBC Arena which was graced by Mr Chan Chun Sing,
Minister of Education. The ceremony emphasized the importance of values
and character that form the foundation of sporting excellence. Our Woodgrovians
cheered together with 30 other schools from all over Singapore in the NSG
Cheer with gusto and pride. They also experienced a unique opportunity
to view the Secondary school’s NSG competitions at the OCBC Arena. Watching
their senior counterparts definitely motivated our own sports teams to
strive even harder for the upcoming Primary Schools NSG.</p>
<p>Back in school, we prepared for our very own Woodgrove NSG Opening Ceremony
and what a proud moment it was for the representatives from Badminton,
Table Tennis, Football, Rope Skipping and Basketball! They stood proudly
on stage for the Athlete’s Oath as well as recited our own Woodgrovian
Pledge, reiterating character development through sporting excellence.</p>
<p>The ceremony marks our Woodgovian’s participation in the NSG and we wish
them all the best as they strive towards Sporting and Character Excellence.</p>

<h3>Happy Birthday Woodgrove!.</h3>
<p>We had a blast during our first Monthly Birthday celebration on 3 Jan
2024. The occasion was more special than usual as we also kickstarted our
school’s 25th Anniversary Celebrations. Not only do we have a special rendition
of the “Happy Birthday” song – with our staff playing the Kalimba (a thumb
piano), it was also cakes galore for everyone. To top it off, every family
also receives one of commemorative Woodgrovian bears – Sparkle and Shine!
Watch the video and share our joy!</p>
