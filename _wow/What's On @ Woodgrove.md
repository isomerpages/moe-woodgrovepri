<h3><strong>Happy Birthday Woodgrove!.</strong></h3><p>We had a blast during our first Monthly Birthday celebration on 3 Jan 2024. The occasion was more special than usual as we also kickstarted our school’s 25th Anniversary Celebrations. Not only do we have a special rendition of the “Happy Birthday” song – with our staff playing the Kalimba (a thumb piano), it was also cakes galore for everyone. To top it off, every family also receives one of commemorative Woodgrovian bears – Sparkle and Shine! Watch the video and share our joy!</p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/okIOlc2Zk6k?si=uMjJd1QMEZ3BzmGZ&amp;rel=0"></iframe></div><hr><h3><strong>Welcoming P1 to the Woodgrovian family!</strong></h3><p>Our 2023 P6 students embarked on a air dry clay figurine project to welcome 2024 P1 students to our Woodgrove family.</p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Yy6mIBIGYM?si=y0WK2dBS4EolgeRx&amp;rel=0"></iframe></div><p></p><p>"On 2 January, Tuesday we welcome our new P1 Woodgrovians!
