<p><strong>Celebrating 25th birthday!</strong></p><p>We had a blast during our first Monthly Birthday celebration on 2 Jan 2024. The occasion was more special than usual as we also kickstarted our school’s 25th Anniversary Celebrations. Not only do we have a special rendition of the “Happy Birthday” song – with our staff playing the Kamlimba (a thumb piano), it was also cakes galore for everyone. To top it off, every family also receives one of commemorative Woodgrovian bears – Sparkle and Shine! Watch the video and share our joy! </p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OgQ-XUdOkH8?si=Nacfu2N8CTsvP0_l&amp;rel=0"></iframe></div><p></p><hr><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Welcoming P1 to the Woodgrovian family!</strong></p><p>Our 2023 P6 students embarked on a air dry clay figurine project to welcome 2024 P1 students to our Woodgrove family.</p><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Yy6mIBIGYM?si=y0WK2dBS4EolgeRx&amp;rel=0"></iframe></div><p></p><p></p>
