<p>Our P1 Woodgrovians’ first day was filled with smiles, encouragement and
many firsts! With parents, teachers and student leaders supporting them
throughout, our P1 Woodgrovians were guided through registration, school
routines and fun learning moments with confidence and care. Each small
step helped our P1s grow in independence and settle happily into school
life.
<br>
<br>A shout-out to our P1 parents &amp; guardians for their strong partnership
as we journey together with our P1 Woodgrovians!</p>
