<p>Knots of Kindness is a Primary 6 Art Legacy Project by our 2025 graduating
students, created to give a warm welcome to our Primary 1 Woodgrovians.
Through learning macramé, our seniors crafted keychains filled with care
and loving intention. Each knot symbolises friendship, gratitude, and the
lasting connections that bind our Woodgrove family together. Joined by
our beloved mascot Shimmer, these handmade gifts offer a warm embrace to
our 2026 Primary 1 Woodgrovians. This heartfelt exchange from seniors to
juniors weaves creativity, care, and legacy into a beautiful welcome for
the P1 Woodgrovians.</p>

<p>Our P1 Woodgrovians’ first day was filled with smiles, encouragement and
many firsts! With parents, teachers and student leaders supporting them
throughout, our P1 Woodgrovians were guided through registration, school
routines and fun learning moments with confidence and care. Each small
step helped our P1s grow in independence and settle happily into school
life.
<br>
<br>A shout-out to our P1 parents &amp; guardians for their strong partnership
as we journey together with our P1 Woodgrovians!</p>
