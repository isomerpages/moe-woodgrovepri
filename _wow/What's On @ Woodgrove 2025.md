<h2>2025 Orientation Programme (Day 1 - 3)</h2>
<h3></h3>
<p>School Start Orientation Programme</p>
<p>We kicked off the new school year with our exciting Orientation Programme,
filled with fun and vibrant activities. On the first day, our Woodgrovians
were thrilled to be greeted by our beloved mascots, Sparkle and Shine!</p>
<p>Helping our Woodgrovians to discover more about themselves, Woodgrovians
engaged in meaningful iGrow lessons where they learn more about our iGR3ACE
values and also their role in making Woodgrove Primary School a welcoming
community for all.</p>
<p>Our P6 Woodgrovians also embarked on an enriching learning journey to
the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) during this Orientation. And to top
off the great start, our Primary 3 Woodgrovians were crowned the Level
Champion 2024. The ecstatic atmosphere of the occasion was further hyped
through the level cheer competitions, with every level turning up in high
spirits. Closing the entire programme on a sweet note, we celebrated the
birthdays of our Woodgrovians and staff, marking a fun and memorable start
to the year.</p>
<p>We are eager and ready to for more new adventures this year!</p>

<p>Our 2024 P6 Woodgrovians undertook project of giving and sharing as they
put their creativity in crafting air-dry clay figurines to warmly welcome
the 2025 P1 students into the Woodgrove family. Through this initiative,
we hope to create a caring and enabling school environment to strengthen
the sense of belonging and ensure that our youngest members feel embraced
as they begin their first steps into primary school. Welcome to the school,
our P1 Woodgrovians!</p>
<h2>Welcoming P1 to Our Woodgrove family</h2>

<p>The first day of school for our Primary One students at Woodgrove Primary
School was a heartwarming and fun-filled experience, filled with moments
of joy, curiosity, and connection. The P1 Woodgrovians were warmly welcomed
by our Sparkle &amp; Shine mascots and greeted by our P2 and P3 ambassadors
dressed in vibrant costumes! Parents joined in various engagement activities,
including a special opportunity to accompany their children during their
first recess. Together, they explored the canteen, navigated food choices,
and shared this memorable moment, easing the transition for the little
ones.</p>
<p>From being warmly greeted to exploring their classrooms and participating
in interactive orientation activities, the children embraced their new
school environment with excitement and smiles. The day was filled with
laughter and a sense of belonging as Woodgrovians and parents alike became
part of the Woodgrove family, setting the tone for a year of joyful learning
ahead.</p>
