<p>The first day of school for our Primary One students at Woodgrove Primary
School was a heartwarming and fun-filled experience, filled with moments
of joy, curiosity, and connection. The P1 Woodgrovians were warmly welcomed
by our Sparkle &amp; Shine mascots and greeted by our P2 and P3 ambassadors
dressed in vibrant costumes! Parents joined in various engagement activities,
including a special opportunity to accompany their children during their
first recess. Together, they explored the canteen, navigated food choices,
and shared this memorable moment, easing the transition for the little
ones.</p>
<p>From being warmly greeted to exploring their classrooms and participating
in interactive orientation activities, the children embraced their new
school environment with excitement and smiles. The day was filled with
laughter and a sense of belonging as Woodgrovians and parents alike became
part of the Woodgrove family, setting the tone for a year of joyful learning
ahead.</p>
