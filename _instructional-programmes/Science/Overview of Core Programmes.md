<h1><b>Overview of Core Programmes</b></h1>

At Woodgrove Primary School, we recognise that each child is unique and has different interests and learning needs. Aligned with the school’s vision of Every Woodgrovian Shines - A Learner. A Contributor. A Leader with Character, the Science department provides a customised curriculum that meets the needs of each student to help him or her achieve his or her fullest potential.

<h3>Core Department Programmes</h3>

<b>Modified 6E Model for Inquiry Based Science Learning</b>

Inquiry-based Science learning is a learner-centred approach where students are encouraged to discover or construct scientific knowledge and concepts by themselves or with peers instead of having teachers directly revealing the learning content. The approach is also effective in developing Scientific process skills in students.

<b>Flipped Learning</b>

To encourage self-directed learning, students will learn key Science concepts and process skills through self-paced online lessons in student learning space (SLS).

**Project Work**

Designed to allow students to apply their learning across subjects, Project Work is part of the whole school approach towards the development of 21st century skills. It provides the opportunity for students to work in groups and learn cooperative and collaborative skills.

**Learning Journeys**

Learning journeys are organised to enrich student’ learning beyond the classrooms. The experiential learning provides opportunities for students to explore, discover and experience Science in everyday life, and develop positive attitude such as care and concern for the environment, and develop a sense of global responsibility.

<b>Ecogarden Learning Trails</b>

The Science Ecogarden trails are designed to provide student-centric learning experiences which build on student’ interest in and stimulate their curiosity about their environment. They serve to provide a rich diversity of learning experiences that cater not only to the cognitive aspects, but also the physical, aesthetic, moral and socio-emotional domains.

<b>Joy In Science</b>

<b>Science Buskers</b>

Students will present interesting Science experiments or facts to their peers or lower primary pupils.  Through such activities, pupils develop a curiosity and interest for Science and improve their creativity, communication skills and confidence.

<b>Changemakers</b>

Changemakers programme builds servant leadership as students explore ways to solve authentic real-life problems using their scientific knowledge and skills.

<b>Talent Development Programme</b>

<b>Science Olympiad workshops</b>

The Science Olympiad workshops aim to ignite student’ passion in Science Learning beyond the Primary School syllabus.

<b>Excellence 2000 (E2K) Science Programme</b>

The E2K Science Programme is a science enrichment programme developed by the Israel Centre for Excellence through Education (ICEE) and endorsed by the Singapore Gifted Education Branch. Through a selection process, students who demonstrate high interest and ability in science will be selected to participate in E2K programmes.
