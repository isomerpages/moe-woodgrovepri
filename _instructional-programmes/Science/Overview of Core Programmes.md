# **Overview of Core Programmes**

At Woodgrove Primary School, we recognise that each child is unique and has different interests and learning needs. Aligned with the school’s vision of Every Child Succeeds - A Learner. A Thinker. A Leader with Character, the Science department provides a customised curriculum that meets the needs of each pupil to help him or her achieve his or her fullest potential.
