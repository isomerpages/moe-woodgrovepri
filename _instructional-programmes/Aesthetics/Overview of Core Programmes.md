# **Overview of Core Programmes**

### PHILOSOPHY

**Holistic education**

It is the department’s belief that arts education contributes to the quality of pupils’ holistic education and plays a part in nurturing them to become informed audiences for the arts. Through positive learning experiences in arts, pupils develop visual literacy, listening and appreciation skills which enable them to observe and perceive the world with increased awareness and aesthetic sensitivity. We also aim to identify pupils with potential in art and further nurture their artistic talents.

**Visual Literacy and Lifelong Interest in the Arts**

Through the learning of art, students develop visual literacy which enables them to observe and perceive their world with increased awareness and aesthetic sensitivity. It also encourages the development of creativity, and this lays the foundation for students’ lifelong appreciation and interest in Arts.

**Vibrant Arts Culture**

The school aims to develop a vibrant teaching and learning environment with a comprehensive art curriculum that involves students and teachers in art experiences and integrated Arts programmes at many levels: the classroom, across different disciplines, at school-wide level and beyond.

### School Goals

Nurturing Young Artists: Achievements & Development in Arts

Strategies:

*   Niche area for development (CERAMICS)
*   Sustain talent development programme to develop an early interest in the Arts and talent development (P2-6 Art Club)
*   Enhancement of co-curriculum programmes for participation based on interest
*   4Cs (Competency-Connection-Choice-Care)

### E3 FRAMEWORK

 **(EXPOSE-EXPERIENCE-EXCELLENCE)**

The objectives of the curriculum are achieved through the framework EXPOSE, EXPERIENCE and EXCELLENCE. We will expose students to various art forms, through special programmes and learning journeys; create experiences to develop students’ knowledge and skills in the arts through curriculum and enrichment programmes; as well as to provide them opportunities to demonstrate excellence through school-based and external performances and competitions.

| XPOSE<br>  	| EXPERIENCE 	| EXCELLENCE 	|
|---	|---	|---	|
| <br>In Expose, each student will be given the opportunity to observe and respond to what he sees. He will also develop visual enquiry skills and acquire necessary art techniques.<br><br>This heightens their sensory awareness, arouses curiosity and encourages imagination and generation of ideas. 	| <br>In Experience, each student will generate ideas from the expose stage and explore ways to communicate his thoughts, ideas, emotions and experiences. Students will communicate them through the acquired art techniques.<br> 	| <br>In Excellence, selected students under the school’s Talent Development programme (Art Club), will have the opportunity to celebrate their creative expressions through in-depth study of the area identified and share their artwork.<br><br>Students will be able to create original artworks to express personal responses (individuality as an artist creating artworks for a targeted audience and the world (reason behind the artwork) and personality in their artwork, materials or techniques of choice. 	|
