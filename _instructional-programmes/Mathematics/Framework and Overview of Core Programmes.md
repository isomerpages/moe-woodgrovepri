### Programmes

**Concrete – Pictorial – Abstract (CPA) Approach**

The CPA Approach provides a sound pedagogical model in the development of concepts and skills. Under the CPA approach, students develop mathematical concepts and skills progressively from the concrete and pictorial levels to the abstract level. Learning will be made meaningful and fun through careful selection of contexts and age-appropriate activities.

**Math Rich Tasks**

Math rich tasks are authentic learning task designed to provide students with rich and diverse learning experiences. 

Key features  of rich tasks include a focus on collaborative learning and the application of mathematics knowledge to real-world contexts. 

They make learning mathematics accessible to all students  due to their low threshold  (simple enough to encourage everyone to start) and high ceiling (open-ended to allow for extension in learning- critical thinking and higher-order problem solving) nature.




**High Ability Programme**

The key objective of the programme is to stretch higher ability students via a curriculum that moves at a faster pace, goes deeper into important thought processes and covers a broader set  of ideas than that in the textbook, level worksheets and problem-solving worksheets.

### Enrichment

**Math Olympiad**

The key objective is to help students acquire and understand the core thinking skills and prepare them for the rigour of competitive mathematics. The programme, with a high focus on non-routine Mathematics problem sums, provides opportunities for students to apply thinking skills to solve specific problems and cultivate in them, a passion and interest in managing questions of increasing level of difficulty. It stretches and instils confidence in the brighter students.

**Excellence 2000 (E2K) Mathematics Programme**

The E2K Mathematics Programme Singapore is a Mathematics enrichment programme developed by the Israel Centre for Excellence through Education (ICEE). The programme, which is rolled out for selected P4, P5 and P6 students, uses game-based learning to expand students’ horizons and reinforces their confidence in their ability to cope with scholastic changes.

**Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN)**

The main objective of the project is to raise the confidence and achievement of low progress learners. It is also aimed at building teachers’ capacity to support low progress learners. Teachers will implement ICAN strategies in class by:

* Fostering a positive class climate and building routines
* Understanding the learning needs and matching pedagogical strategies
* Using available resources to diagnose and intervene appropriately

### Special Project

**Learning Support for Math (LSM)**

Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) is an early intervention effort aimed at providing additional support to students who do not have foundational numeracy skills and knowledge to access the Primary 1 Math curriculum. Students are identified for the intervention through a screening process carried out at the beginning of Primary 1. They are supported by a LSM Teacher for 4–8 periods a week. The programme is extended to students at P2 and P3 who require the extra support.
