<li>
<p>As part of the school’s effort to improve students’ welfare, the school
has introduced snack break scheduled before or after recess. Students may
bring their own snacks such as buns or fruits for consumption in class
during the snack break. This is to cater to students who come to school
without breakfast or those who may be hungry prior to dismissal.
<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please do not send your child to school if he/she is unwell with any of
the following infectious diseases or symptoms: Hand-foot-and-mouth diseases
(HFMD), chicken pox, red eye (conjunctivitis), gastric flu, fever, cough,
vomiting, sore throat, runny nose, etc. To prevent the spread of infection,
a child who is unwell or is given a medical certificate by the doctor should
stay at home to rest. Any sick children will not be allowed to stay in
the school.
<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are expected to attend school regularly. Any absence from school
must be verified by a doctor’s medical certificate or letter from the parents
(for urgent private matters). This should be handed to the form teacher
when the child returns to school. If a child falls sick while in school,
his/her parents/guardian will be informed to take him/her home.
<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students will be considered absent without valid reason should they go
overseas for holidays during the school term.
<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should you need to contact your child’s/ward’s teacher, please email the
teacher using the information found on our school website.
<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our students should learn to be independent and responsible. To inculcate
them the good habits of checking their own bags each night, school will
not accept and deliver personal items (e.g. homework, keys, pocket money,
books, stationery, water bottles and food) to the students.
<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are advised not to bring their handphones to school. Those who
need the handphone for communication with home with be issued a handphones
pass after they have obtained parental permission and agreed to adhere
to school handphone guidelines.
<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parents are discouraged from organising birthday celebrations for their
children in school. This is to minimise the risk of food allergies and
reduce comparison amongst students.
