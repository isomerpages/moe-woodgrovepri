At Woodgrove Primary, we strongly believe that every child is unique and can shine. Our children are engaged in a plethora of specially designed programmes and immersed in a myriad of holistic experiences, focusing on their needs, building their character, nurturing their hearts and enriching their minds. Balanced with the talent development opportunities, we seek to develop our children’s potential to bring out the best in them and help them shine.

With our school vision, mission and values serving as the lighthouse, we have developed our signature school-wide Applied Learning Programme (ALP) Effective Communication Through Drama Pedagogies which aims to nurture our children to be confident and effective communicators, as well as our distinctive Learn for Life Programme (LLP) Shine Through Dance which develops our children’s confidence, creativity and character. Embedded within our suite of signature programmes are also learning experiences that provide opportunities for Woodgrovians to contribute to the community and to efforts towards environmental sustainability. These programmes will equip our children with the necessary values and skills to be future-ready.

As the adage goes, “It takes a village to raise a child.” At Woodgrove Primary, we believe that with our team of dedicated staff and teachers, strong parental support, as well as our valued partnership with our School Advisory Committee (SAC), Parent Support Group (PSG) and community partners, we will be able to realise our vision of **Every Woodgrovian Shines: A Learner. A Contributor. A Leader with Character**.
