# **Homework Policy**

Pupil attainment, progress and guidelines for improvement are to be reported to teacher, pupil and parent through the regular marking of Homework, according to agreed assessment criteria, as outlined in the Homework Policy

Homework is an integral part of effective Assessment. Good practice is promoted through Homework which is set regularly across all departments according to the needs of the pupils and within the School policies and timetables.

School has expectations regarding Homework and pupils may be asked to redo and resubmit homework which fails to meet teacher / departmental standards.

**Objectives of Homework**

For the student, regular Homework encourages:

* consolidation and extension of learning
* monitoring of progress
* independent learning
* self discipline, personal organisation and responsibility
* home/school partnership

For the teachers, judicious use of homework allows teachers to: 

* check for students’ understanding and progress, so as to provide timely feedback, intervention and support; and
* review effectiveness of their lessons.




**Appropriate homework load for the different levels of students**
