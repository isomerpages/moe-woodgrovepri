<p><strong><u>Invitation to onboard Parents Gateway</u></strong>
<br>Developed by the Ministry of Education (MOE) and GovTech, Parents Gateway
(PG) is a one-stop portal that strengthens school-home partnership to support
your child/ward in his/her education journey.
<br>
<br>The app enables you to receive information from the school and MOE, and
to perform a range of administrative functions such as giving consent for
school activities, and declaring travel plans.
<br>
<br>PG is made available to you before the start of your child’s/ward’s P1
year. Through PG, we will share resources on how you can support and prepare
your child/ward for this transition, as well as provide you with important
administrative information and announcements on P1 Orientation. Please
download the PG app on your mobile phone (available on Google Play, Apple
App Store and Huawei AppGallery) from this <a href="https://pg.moe.edu.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>. Upon successful download, the app
will guide you through a simple one-time onboarding process. You may also
refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.woodgrovepri.moe.edu.sg/files/For%20Parents/PG_Mobile_App_User_Guide_compressed.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">PG Mobile App User Guide</a>&nbsp;for
the step-by-step guide.
<br>
<br>If you have successfully onboarded Parents Gateway previously, and are
receiving notifications via the app, you need not undergo the onboarding
process or download the app again. Please note that parents, legal guardians
and authorised caregivers will have continued access to the app, as long
as your child/ward is studying in an MOE school (P1 – JC2).</p>
