# **Parents Support Group**

The school recognizes the importance of a strong school-parent partnership in enhancing the development and learning of our children. Known as VOWs (Volunteers of Woodgrove) which was formed in 2001, the group has grown to more than 200 volunteers in 2008.

For parents of current students who are keen to volunteer your services and play a more active role in your child's education and development, you can write to the person in-charge, Mrs Lim-Seow Joo Hwang at [lim-seow\_joo\_hwang@schools.gov.sg](mailto:lim-seow_joo_hwang@schools.gov.sg)
