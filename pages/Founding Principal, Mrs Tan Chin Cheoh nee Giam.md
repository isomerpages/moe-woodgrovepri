<p><strong>Rivers flow endlessly, Woodgrovians develop and shine perpetually </strong>

</p>
<p>Woodgrove’s celebration of its 25th Anniversary marks a quarter of a century
of success, growth and resilience. I have nostalgic memories of the school’s
humble beginnings when it started in January 1999 with a mere 360 Primary
One pupils, 12 teachers and 3 support staff members. Few will recall or
even know that we were temporarily housed in nearby Woodlands Ring Primary
School. Within a few months however, due to the unexpected urgency and
requests from parents, other levels had to be started leading to an increase
in the intake of another 300 pupils. The school officially moved to its
present premises on 5 September 1999. Over the next few years, there was
balloting annually for Primary One vacancies with hundreds of unsuccessful
disappointed parents who had to be turned away. The school’s enrolment
increased by leaps and bounds to more than 2650 pupils in 2005.</p>
<p>Student learning outcomes were always the priority and the paramount considerations
underlying our approach to the different activities and programmes planned
for all levels. The collective competencies and professionalism of the
teachers had a great impact and resulted in pupils’ achievements despite
diverse pupil abilities.</p>
<p>Being the new kid on the block, Woodgrove Primary School had to quickly
set itself apart. We wanted to provide holistic education and reflect the
school’s emphasis on non-academic aspects. For example, from 2002, the
school introduced 2 programmes, similar to the Programme for Active Learning
(PAL) which was implemented in primary schools in 2017.</p>
<p>Friends At Socialising Time (FAST) focused on sports and outdoor education,
allowing pupils to try their hand at soccer, wushu and a wide array of
other outdoor activities. In Developing Arts Talents in Education (DATE)
pupils participated in mural painting, creative dance and pottery, just
to name a few. In short, the pupils had a buffet which allowed them to
explore and discover their interests and talents.</p>
<p>On the academic side, notable programmes implemented included ‘Learning
Is Fun Time’ (LIFT) and the ‘Making Education Glowing and Accelerative’
(MEGA). LIFT gave the opportunity for Primary One pupils to learn Mother
Tongue and English languages through fun filled activities on Saturday
mornings. MEGA integrated high ability pupils from Primary Two and Primary
Three in larger classes of 60 students to cultivate socio emotional competencies
as they underwent the stimulating and challenging daily lessons. This resulted
in a credible number of pupils from the MEGA classes being absorbed into
the Gifted Education Programme (GEP).</p>
<p>As the school operated in two sessions at the time, with Primary Twos,
Primary Fours and Primary Sixes in the morning and the rest of the levels
in the afternoon, there was a critical need to look for classrooms to conduct
supplementary or remedial lessons after curriculum hours. We were indeed
fortunate to have been able to use some of the spare classrooms in the
then newly opened Sports School for our teachers to support the Primary
Six pupils taking the Primary School Leaving Exam (PSLE). This accounted
for the school’s commendable PSLE results in our early years. I am to this
day grateful to the first Principal of the Sports School for his congenial
spirit in facilitating our efforts to help our pupils attain academic success.</p>
<p>I am convinced that our effective management of the multifaceted tasks
during the school’s early developmental years paved the way and laid the
cornerstone for Woodgrove Primary School to thrive and overcome the challenges
it faced. Indeed, Woodgrove Primary School has grown from strength to strength
upholding high standards of imparting holistic education and this has manifested
itself in being a choice school in the neighbourhood</p>
